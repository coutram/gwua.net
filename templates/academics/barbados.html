	<p>In keeping with our mission to provide high-quality graduate and post-graduate education for men and women actively engaged in Christian service and our desire for our students to impact the world, Hamilton College of the Bahamas has developed affiliate partnerships in other countries with learning centers or colleges offering traditional classes in programs compatible with those offered by Hamilton College of the Bahamas and whose mission and goals are in harmony with those of Hamilton College of the Bahamas. Such schools are required to submit academic materials to the university for yearly review to ensure their academic standard meets or exceeds those adopted by Hamilton College of the Bahamas. Students graduating from affiliates may choose to receive their diploma from Hamilton College of the Bahamas, though the diploma will clearly reflect that the program of study was from the specific independent learning center where courses were taken. Any online courses students desire to take will be offered exclusively through Hamilton College of the Bahamas's Veda course deployment system administered by Hamilton College of the Bahamas instructors. Tuition prices for those online courses will be determined by the affiliate.</p>
