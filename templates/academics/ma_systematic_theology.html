<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>Much of the theological understanding of Christians today comes from popular books, television personalities, and their own “gut” feelings. We are quickly becoming a society that has no foundation for theological beliefs, where truth is relative and elusive. There is a tremendous need today for scholars who are learned in systematic theology, people who can collect and synthesize all relevant biblical passages and communicate the truths expressed by the whole of the Word of God.</p><p>The MAST program is designed to help students study the Bible topically in a manner that is consistent with good scholarship and that challenges them to relate their teachings to today’s Christian church. The program also includes some philosophical theology courses which aim to cultivate critical thinking and to help students realize the dangers of not looking to Scripture itself as the source of our theology. Students who complete this program will be able to logically develop theological positions from a careful and scholarly analysis of relevant Scripture passages.</p><p><strong>Intended audience</strong></p><p>This course is designed for ministry professionals who desire to use the whole counsel of the Word of God to formulate theological positions, without being overly influenced by the opinions of others or their own predispositions. It is also suitable for laypeople who seek a greater understanding of the theological principles taught in Scripture and how to correctly interpret them.</p><table width="100%" bgcolor="#f7f7f7" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" bgcolor="#cccccc">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#cccccc"><div align="right"><strong>Credits</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><strong>Core Courses Required</strong> (10 Courses, 30 Credits)</td></tr><tr><td>THEO 502 </td><td>Systematic Theology I </td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 503</td><td>Systematic Theology II</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 504</td><td>Theology and Philosophy</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 601</td><td>Advanced Evangelical Systematic Theology I</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 602</td><td>Advanced Evangelical Systematic Theology II</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 507</td><td>Wesleyanism: A Theology of Love</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 523</td><td>Dispensationalism versus Covenant Theology</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 621</td><td>Protestant Gnosticism</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 622</td><td>Christian Mysticism</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>BIB 504</td><td>Hermeneutics</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#ffffff">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#ffffff">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#cccccc">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#cccccc">&nbsp;</td><td bgcolor="#cccccc"><div align="right"><strong>Credits</strong></div></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" bgcolor="#eeeeee"><strong>Thesis (6 credits):</strong></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 591 </td><td>Research / Directed Readings</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr><tr><td>THEO 592 </td><td>Thesis</td><td><div align="right">(3)</div></td></tr></tbody></table>
