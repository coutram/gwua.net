	<p>A Bachelor of Science/Master of Science joint degree program is available for qualified Industrial Engineering undergraduate students, which allows students to complete a Master of Science degree in two or three semesters after completion of the Bachelor of Science degree. Students in the joint degree program are allowed to take up to 12 semester hours of 100- or 200-level courses toward the M.S. degree and attend the Industrial Engineering Program's graduate seminar in place of the undergraduate seminar before the conferral of the Bachelor of Science degree. Of these courses, 6 semester hours may be counted towards both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. The requirements for admission to the program are (a) completion of at least 80 semester hours of credits, (b) a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.25 or higher, and (c) a letter of application submitted to the Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering Chairperson before the start of senior year. A student in the combined program receives a B.S. degree when all requirements for that degree have been completed, and then becomes a regular M.S. level graduate student in the department. Students in the program may usually work with a faculty member on a M.S. thesis project during the senior year of undergraduate study. </p>
